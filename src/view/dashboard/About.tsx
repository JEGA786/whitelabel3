            In December 2020, Spice Money joined hands with actor and
            philanthropist Sonu Sood with a shared vision of harnessing the
            power of technology to promote entrepreneurship among the rural and
            semi-urban population. Together with Sonu Sood, the company
            reinvented it into a new identity – Spice Money to Life Bani
            encapsulating the brand philosophy of bringing real change in the
            lives of its customers & Adhikaris.
            <br />
            Spice Money has been constantly innovating to expand its reach to
            the underbanked and underserved parts of India. In February 2021, a
            zero-investment business initiative was launched that removed the
            barrier of entry for aspiring young rural entrepreneurs and enabled
            them to become a part of the Spice Money network completely free of
            cost with their very own ‘Digital Dukaan’.
            <br />
            Spice Money is also building India’s largest mATM Network to address
            the critical issue of inaccessibility to ATMs and physical banking
            infrastructure for those living in rural India. Spice Money has
            successfully activated more than 1,00,000 micro-ATMs throughout its
            network. As a testimony of its commitment, Spice Money has even
            covered India’s last village, Chitkul with its very first ATM
            network.

            Spice Money is constantly working towards driving innovative
            tech-driven solutions to empower rural citizens and drive financial
            inclusion across the country.
